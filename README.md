# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling
This project leverages the Corona Virus Report dataset from Kaggle to analyze global COVID-19 data and build predictive models that assess and classify the severity of the pandemic across countries and WHO regions.

The dataset provides daily updates on COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases worldwide.

## 📊 Data Management & Analysis
Used SQL queries to:

- Extract and aggregate key metrics such as total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries by country and WHO region.

- Identify countries with the highest recovery rates, confirmed cases, and fatalities.

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed comprehensive EDA to uncover trends and patterns, including:

- Top 10 countries by confirmed cases (highest and lowest)

- Top 10 countries with most deaths and active cases

- Correlation heatmap of critical variables: Deaths, Recovered, Active, and Confirmed cases

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

- Linear Regression: Predicted confirmed cases based on Deaths, Recovered, Active, and New cases

- Random Forest Classifier: Classified pandemic severity with 96% accuracy, validated by confusion matrix

- Clustering: Grouped countries based on pandemic impact using clustering techniques

- Naive Bayes Classifiers: Achieved 92% accuracy with Gaussian Naive Bayes and 81% with Bernoulli Naive Bayes

## 📉 Visualizations

- Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn for clear visual representation of data insights and model results.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- SQL – data extraction and aggregation

- Python (Pandas) – data processing

- Matplotlib, Seaborn – data visualization

- Scikit-learn – machine learning models
